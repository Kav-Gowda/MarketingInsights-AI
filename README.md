# MarketingInsights AI

A machine learning and neural network–based project for marketing analytics and sales forecasting. This project explores how data-driven insights and deep learning techniques can be applied to understand the effects of promotions, markdowns, and holidays on retail sales.

---

## 🚀 Overview
MarketingInsights AI merges real-world retail datasets to build predictive models that forecast department-level sales and analyze how different factors—like markdowns, fuel prices, and holidays—impact revenue performance.  
The project compares traditional regression approaches with deep neural networks to uncover the most effective forecasting strategy.
